# Search DevDocs


## About
This is a [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) plugin allowing you to easily search the DevDocs documentation.

The plugin code is based on the [Stackoverflow Plugin](https://github.com/ericmartel/Sublime-Text-2-Stackoverflow-Plugin) script by Eric Martel.


## Usage

### Search by selection
Highlight text, right click & click "Search DevDocs" to open a new tab on your web browser with the info.

### Search by input
1. Open your command pallete with `ctrl + shift + p` (Linux/Windows) or `cmd + shift + p` (OS X)
2. Type "devdocs"
3. Click on "Search From Input"
4. Type your keyword

***You can also use the shortcut (`ctrl + shift + d`).***

> To search a specific documentation, type its name and a space before your keyword. (e.g: js date)


## Installation
The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

* If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
* Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
* Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
* Select DevDocs when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Git up to date with the latest version.
